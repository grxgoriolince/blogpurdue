# Work... kinda works?

The plunge down to the millimeter sized bodies has been full of turbulence. The code I was relying, aneos15km.f, does not work for sub-kilometer sizes apparently. One of the other available codes, aneossmall.f, seems suspiciously named aptly for the job. However, it does not work either. The simulation flow has stagnated a little bit due to these hiccups, but worry not, I will get them figured out. 

I also developed a couple of extra scripts to streamline run initialization; a runner to launch as many simulations as possible simultaneously and an input editor to tweak initial conditions for as many files as possible with a single run. These should help save time that would otherwise be spent manually opening 50 terminals one by one.

I am currently pushing the office machine to its limits, running 20 simulations at once. I am closely monitoring the diagnostics window to make sure that the memory isn't overrun. 

In other words, I have ramped up efficiency significantly. My efforts are now focused on getting those meter magnitude results (and then centimeter, and then millimeter). 

# Boilermaker Bookworms (Name WIP)

I finished Jurassic Park; it was pretty good, a solid 8/10. I felt like it dragged on a little bit in the end.

I started the first classic of the ones I plan on reading: Pride and Prejudice. It has so far absorbed me; it is beautifully, albeit complicatedly, written. It has challenged my language skills; I keep a dictionary open next to the book. 

The following passage I found spectacular: "But no sooner had he made it clear to himself and his friends that she had hardly a good feature in her face, than he began to find it was rendered uncommonly intelligent by the beautiful expression of her dark eyes. 

To this discovery succeeded some others equally mortifying. Though he had detected with a critical eye more than one failure of perfect symmetry in her form, he was forced to acknowledge her figure to be light and pleasing; and in spjite of his asserting that her manners were not those of the fashionable world, he was caught by her easy playfulness." Mr. Darcy paints quite the picture.
