# ICARUS Simulations
    I have been running simulations now for a few weeks, learning how to use the behemoth of a computational system that Dr. Johnson and his advisor, Dr. Melosh, developed. I have to iterate through a range of impactor sizes (10 - 10000 km) and velocities (15 - 50 km/s), simulating how each different sized body produces a crater at different velocities, in order to classify and visualize different parameters of the respective ejecta produced. I'm running five main simulations right now, as I'm still testing how far I can take the office mac (macOS on an Intel(R) Xeon(R) W-3235 CPU processor at106 3.30 GHz, with 12 physical and 24 logical cores, 96 GB ram, and an AMD Radeon Pro 580X GPU) without it running out of memory, as these runs are pretty computational power-intensive, producing multiple GB-sized output files.

    The plan for now is to recreate the runs in Icarus, with the intent of extending the impactor size range down to sub-millimeter magnitudes eventually.
