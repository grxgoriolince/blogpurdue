# ICARUS Simulations
    The first few meetings with Dr. Johnson and Dr. Wakita went pretty well. I'm not gonna lie, I was a little bit overwhelmed and anxious in my first meeting with Dr. Wakita, as I did not understand the code too much. However, I took my time, studied it, and felt a lot better by the next day I was in office; so so far, so good.

    I have been running simulations now for a few weeks, learning how to use the behemoth of a computational system that Dr. Johnson and his advisor, Dr. Melosh, developed. I have to iterate through a range of impactor sizes (10 - 10000 km) and velocities (15 - 50 km/s), simulating how each different sized body produces a crater at different velocities, in order to classify and visualize different parameters of the respective ejecta produced. I'm running five main simulations right now, as I'm still testing how far I can take the office mac (macOS on an Intel(R) Xeon(R) W-3235 CPU processor at106 3.30 GHz, with 12 physical and 24 logical cores, 96 GB ram, and an AMD Radeon Pro 580X GPU) without it running out of memory, as these runs are pretty computational power-intensive, producing multiple GB-sized output files.

    The plan for now is to recreate the runs in Icarus, with the intent of extending the impactor size range down to sub-millimeter magnitudes eventually. _Eventually_.

## UREP-C
    As for the UREP-C program and the people, adjusting has been very easy. My roommates are three good friends from my major and semester back home; Thomas, who's in math; Agustin, in optics; and Juan Camilo, in quantum topology. Our previous friendship makes cohabitation great, as we mantain open communication and hang out pretty much every day. We set up systems for cooking and cleaning; hopefully these last the whole semester.

    We went to a nice welcome party for all of the UREP-C students, hosted by some of our companions, and met most people. They've come from essentially every part of Colombia, which creates a very familiar environment while still being quite diverse. The subjects on which everyone works range from marketing and psychology to botany and quantum computing, which makes the academic landscape quite interesting, providing amazing opportunities to learn about topics beyond each one's own.

## Recent reads
    I have two passages in my head that I haven't been able to stop thinking about. 

    Soren Kierkegaard says, "I have just returned from a party of which I was the life and soul; witty banter flowed from my lips, everyone laughed and admired me -- but I came  away, indeed that dash should be as long as the radii of the earth's orbit ------------------wanting to shoot myself." 

    On a more positive note, Seneca also had an impact on me; about worry, he says, "We suffer more in imagination than in reality." I might just tattoo those words on my forehead.
