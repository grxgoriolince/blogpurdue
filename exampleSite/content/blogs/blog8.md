# 24 Summers, now

I turned 24 yesterday. It was a nice birthday; warm day, slept in late, relaxed. I'm ready for whatever this next year has to bring.

## Work updates

Some quick work updates; we breached the meter limit. We now have the first 10 cm sized impactor results; the centimer and millimeter sizes still won't budge. I'll keep you updated.

For now, this is the last entry for the practice project in EAFIT; that is, the ones that are to be graded are done. I am also about turn in the final draft of the project, the document that collects all I have done here. I am confident I'll do well.

## Fourth of July!

United States day! We celebrated Juanca's, Michela's, and my birthday on Friday, with an incredible pool party. We basically raided the pool; 50 Colombians from 4 pm to 10 pm just having fun and dancing and singing. I couldn't have asked for a better party. 

## Dr. Johnson's party

On Saturday, I was invited to Dr. Johnson's house for a Fourth of July party. I was kinda nervous at first, but when I got there, that quickly went away, as the hospitality and kindness which with I was received couldn't have been greater. I met Dr. Johnson's wife and three kids; Dr. Wakita and Sowon (Dr. Johnson's graduate student) were there; not being the only international student was very reassuring. Everyone in attendance was extremely nice, from professors to graduate students. The food, cooked by Dr. Johnson, was as Usonian as it gets; ribs, sausages in bread, beer, soda... it was perfect, and the ribs might have just been the best I've ever had.

I sat and talked to other graduate students; Dr. Wakita; Sowon; and even Severin, Dr. Johnson's oldest son, who's apparently a savant at chess. When it got dark, we watched the incredible firework display put on by the neighbors on the lawn. Afterwards, I was sent home with leftovers, and Sowon gave me a ride. Overall, an amazing experience, and I am very grateful to have been received so warmly.

## Books... time left...

I regret to inform I have made no progress on Dracula. 

I am also contemplating a lot lately, as I only have a month left before I go back home; I am going to make the most out of it.

"I feel like a time traveler: June, July, August. Summer dissolves in my mouth and I can't remember what it tasted like." Excerpted from Zoe Lianne's "Erasure".

"An old drunk man told me to enjoy my life and have fun because I'm only 24 and I have so many years and so much life ahead of me and then he went 'and you know what? in ten years when you're 34 you'll still be young and have your whole life ahead of you' and it was really comforting to me."
