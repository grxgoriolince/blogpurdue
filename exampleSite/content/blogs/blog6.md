# Going smaller...

So I have finally breached the kilometer limit. The first iterations of the 100 meter impactor are done, and they are consistent with the trends. This marks a very important part of the project as I have oficially extended the scope of the results presented originally in the paper. 

The current state of Figure 13 is the following:

Very satisfying.

I also developed scripts to recreate Figure 14 of the paper, which has to do with condensation efficiency, both from vapor and from impactor mass. The following figures show condensation fractios for 10, 100, and 1000 km impactors for the entire velocity range.
