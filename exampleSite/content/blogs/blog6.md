# Going smaller...

So I have finally breached the kilometer limit. The first iterations of the 100 meter impactor are done, and they are consistent with the trends. This marks a very important part of the project as I have oficially extended the scope of the results presented originally in the paper. 

The current state of Figure 13 is the following:

Very satisfying.

I also developed scripts to recreate Figure 14 of the paper, which has to do with condensation efficiency, both from vapor and from impactor mass. The following figures show condensation fractions for 10, 100, and 1000 km impactors for the entire velocity range.

        <figcaption style="text-align: center;">1000 km</figcaption>
      </figure>
    </td>
  </tr> 
</table>

These are consistent with the results reported by Dr. Johnson and Dr. Melosh; the project is going well. 

# Chicago

As for trips, I have the pleasure of visiting Chicago with some of my friends; my roommates; Sebastian, a friend from home; and Ryan, a friend we made here at Purdue. The latter was the one who drove us, as he has a car and lives in Joliet, Illinois. We stayed over at his house, too. 

Anyway, I've been to Chicago a few times already during my current stay at the US and each trip I find the city more enchanting than the last. It feels massive, and not just in scale, but in depth; the culture, the people, the architecture... you could be immortal and still never experience the whole thing. This was the first time, however, were we visited the city and it was not freezing. 

We walked around and saw everything we have seen already, and it was still as amazing at the first time. If I ever do stay in the US, I will try my best to live there. 

There were two main attactions that defined this trip: Sebas getting scammed for taking a picture with a parrot (which the city should do something about, these tropical species should NOT be used for these purposes), and the Chicago Art Institue.

## Nighthawks!

I have always been into art; I've been drawing most of my life, to the point where I consider myself decent at it; I love painting, and poetry, and music, and sculpture, and and and... everything, and so I was pretty excited to go to the Art Institute, especially because of Nighthawks.

Now, Nighthawks was a painting I had been wanting to see for a while, ever since my architect friend Daniel told me it was in Chicago. It is a very famous piece, and for a reason; it conveys undescribable emotion, a sort of loneliness or nostaligia or something between the too. And... I saw it! It was beautiful, breathtaking. Just that made the entry price worth it.

Other sections that took my breath were the Monets, the Van Goghs, and American Gothic, among others that I previously did know know about. The whole experience was fascinating, and inspired me to draw again, so much that I bought a new sketchbooks; we'll see what I come up with.

## Books!

I finished Pride and Prejudice and thought it was spectacular. I ventured outside my literary comfort zone and was greatly rewarded for it; I liked it so, in fact, that I have added Jane Eyre to my books-to-read.

I was feeling sci-fi-ish and so I bought Hitchiker's Guide to the Galaxy, the absurd space comedy-opera by Douglas Adams; its a short book, and so I rushed through it, finishing in a couple of days. While I liked it, it was not enough to read the sequel. For now, at least. I loved the randomness and spontaneity, and found some of the concepts presented extremely clever, especially the Infinite Improbability Drive, an object that makes the impossible happen, literally. Satiated my sci-fi cravings for now... next on, classic gothic horror...

The count will bare his teeth...
