Summer's so close I can taste it.

# The impactors are smaller than me now!

Like the title says, we have reached impactor sizes smaller than me (<1.68m, which isn't saying much). We are currently at 1 meter results; I have now produced most of the 100m impactor velocities, some of the 10m, and the first of the 1m. This is where it starts getting tricky, as the code hasn't been used to go this small before, and so error keep popping up left and right. 

Here's an update on Figure 13:

So close to the endgoal, which in case you forgot, is simulating millimeter-sized impactors. Regarding this, an interesting possibility arises; the simulation might stop making physical sense, as the program might compute sub-molecule and angstrom sized nuclei and spherules, which is physically impossible. The theoretical limit for nuclei size is 1.6 angstroms, the approximate size of a single silicate (SiO2) unit; again, this is very rough, as silica forms a network solid rather than existing in discrete particles. This is one of the results I anticipate the most; very interesting stuff.

## A very magical trip

I went back to Chicago, like the Joe Keery song goes, with my friends; my roommates, Samuel, Ximena, and Michela, all fellow Colombians and UREP-C students. Again, even more enchanting than last time. Literally. We went to the Harry Potter store, a place that felt like the Goblet of Fire was real. And it was; a huge goblet of fire was the centerpiece of the store. I almost felt tempted to put my name in it. The shop was wonderful; every possible piece of Harry Potter paraphernalia; had I had money to buy stuff then I would have bought all of the Gryffindor merchandise, even if the quizzes say I am a Slytherin; I have the cunning of a brick. 

The butterbeer, which I had been wanting to try since I was 5 years old, was extremely disappointing. It was essentially Colombiana soda with whipped cream on top with a 15 dollar price tag. Almost ruined my trip. 

On we went, taking pictures of the towering buildings, their ceilings hidden by the clouds; it was a grey and frigid day. We walked down to the zoo along Lakeshore Drive, a place of great significance to me since I first heard the song bu Aliotta Haynes Jeremiah, one of my favorites. The lake was cold and grey, but the shore was teeming with people, running and biking and just general loitering. 

I was not expecting the free zoo to be an actual zoo, you know? It was so complete! Zebras and lions and giraffes and even my namesake, the lynx (lince in spanish)! We watched the gigantic polar bear pace back and forth for a while in his enclosure, and walked back to Millenium Park, where the bus back to West Lafayette was waiting, by the end of the day.

## My dad came to visit

My dad, who lives in Houston, crossed half the country and came to visit me; he stayed for a few days in my room (I slept on the living room couch). We had a fantastic time; hiked, dined, played board games with my roommates... A very fun weekend. It was especially heartwarming to see him bantering, hanging out, and just generally getting along so well with my friends. He gave us the greatest gift of all: an actual full-sized trash can for the kitchen.

## I got a new bike

Yeah, I rented a bike. 

## Books! and just general literary pretentiousness...

"Give me Liberty to know, to utter and to argue freely according to my conscience, above all other liberties: Milton": the script carved on the Chicago Tribune building walls. Electrifying.

I am halfway through Dracula now. My reading habit has stagnated a bit, as I no longer read on the bus, as I commute to and forth campus on bike. I hope to finish it along with my time here.
