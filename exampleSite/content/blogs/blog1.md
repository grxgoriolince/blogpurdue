# Purdue Arrival

 As I start the third week of my Purdue journey, I find it is important to reflect on the path treaded so far. For context: I arrived at Chicago on February the 10th, with three of my fellow physicist friends from EAFIT: Juan Camilo, Agustin, and Thomas. After a few fun days of seeing Chicago for the first time, magical snowfall included, we took a shuttle and arrived at Purdue University on February 14th. The campus is genuinely breathtaking; the sight of the Neil Armstrong Hall of Engineering was incredible, and the sheer size of the recreational center is nauseating. It has the biggest gym I have seen in my life; a dream come true.

## First days of working

In the two following weeks, we have done a myriad of activies; went grocery shopping, walked around the campus, went to a couple of bars and restaurants, met up with the rest of the Colombian cohort, and met with the faculty members that oversee us. In my case, I met up with Dr. Shigeru Wakita, the person who, up until now, has been my direct supervisor. The faculty member that took me in is Dr. Brandon Johnson, a professor at the Department of Earth, Atmospheric, and Planetary Sciences, who I also had the pleasure of meering last week.

### Icarus

These first couple of days I have been recreating the data described by a paper written by Dr. Brandon Johnson on the formation of spherules in large impact events. According to Dr. Johnson in his paper Icarus (Johnson et al., 2011) [^1] , when a large object impacts the surface of the earth, which we take to be made of pure silicate in the model, said silicate is vaporized (forming large vapor plumes)only to be later condensed into small spheres, or spherules. These spherules then spread throughout the earth, waiting to be unearthed by scientist so that we may learn a little bit more about ancient and current impact events. A very interesting aspect of the work being done is that what first demonstrated that the Cretaceous period was ended my a massive asteroid impact was a global layer ejecta  (Alvarez et al., 1980) [^2] 3mm thick that contained higher levels of iridium than normal and spherules of around 250 um (Smit, 1999) [^3] . 

The project outlined by Icarus is a computational model consisting on a one-dimensional Lagrangian hydrocode; that is, a code system developed in Fortran to simulate the formation and growth of spherules after impact. As to what exactly is a one-dimensional Lagrangian hydrocode; a hydrocode is simply a code used to solve problems of hydrodynamics, that is, the behavior of fluids; this specific one utilizes a Lagrangian approach, which follows individual fluid elements as they move, as oppsed to an Eulerian approach, which uses a fixed grid; and lastly, it is one-dimensional as it only simulates the radial coordinate of the vapor plumes.

I have spent the last couple of days going into the lab, room 2261 in the Hampton Hall of Civil Engineering, and reproducing certain results of the original paper, to varying degrees of success. Hopefully the success rate improves this week; I have a meeting with both Dr. Johnson and Dr. Wakita tomorrow. Wish me luck.
