# Autonomy in Space Exploration

Today I attended [a seminar](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5HO_EeTqg4) hosted by Dr. Robert Braun; Space Exploration Sector Head at John Hopkins University, former dean of the College of Engineering and Applied Science at the University of Colorado Boulder, David and Andrew Lewis Professor of Space Technology at the Georgia Institute of Technology, and NASA Chief Technologist; on autonomy in space exploration. After the seminar, multiple prominent scientists and engineers hosted a follow-up panel; Dr. Kenshiro Oguri, professor of astrodynamics at Purdue; Rob Chambers, Senior Director of Space Exploration Strategy at Lockheed Martin; Dr. Ben Pearce, professor of astrobiology at Purdue; Dr. Li Qiao, professor and Associate Head for Engagement and Recognition; and Nadia Numa, Purdue graduate student of Aeronautics and Astronautics and panel moderator. 

Dr. Braun spoke about the past and current state of autonomy in space exploration, mentioning ground-in-the-loop and autonomous operations from a risk perspective, and speculated on the future of spaceflight and how new advances in the field open up mind-boggling possibilities. He referenced his experience working with NASA's Mars Perseverance Rover, Ingenuity Mars Helicopter, Double Asteroid Redirection Test (DART) and Dragonfly teams, state of the art machines that rely on autonomy and control in order to achieve their respective goals, whether that be sample collections or asteroid redirection.

The panel was also extremely interesting, with each member discussing and sharing their experiences in the subject, highlighting challenges that arise from the engineering, science, and current political landscape. They considered the implications of the current state of technologies and how it might develop in the following years, pondering what learning may be acquired from the field.

The whole experience was nothing short of life-changing; so much so that I dared to participate; I nervously inquired Dr. Braun on the possibility of deployable structures. He mentioned remote software updates for systems far away, such as the Perseverance rover, and so I thought, if we can update the software, could we not also update the hardware? Send parts that assemble themselves? His response, which he gave smiling (which I took to mean it was a good question), was that it was in fact possible. Solar sails are a great example of this, and deployable structures have been in thought for space exploration for a while now. This was, in fact, discussed with Nicolas Guarin, my EAFIT mentor, as I joined his group on deployable structure in EAFIT.

I had always had an inclination for engineering, considering my career and the massive range of applications of the field; the talk made it my main pursuit. While I love astrophysics, astronomy, and the theoretical aspect of physics, I want to directly contribute to this new emerging era of human exploration. I want to be part of the forefront of this incredible new endeavor, reaching further than anyone before me. I want to build the machines that take humans to places beyond our wildest imaginations, and the way to do this is to dedicate my life to mechanical and aerospace engineering. As Rocket Raccon eloquently put it, "Someday I'm gonna make great machines that fly."

## Meditations

As for liteature, I recently started reading Meditations, by Marcus Aurelius. I have annotated a few passages, but a few that have stood out to me recently are as follows: 

"The nature of the offender himself is akin to my own. I cannot be harmed by any of them; nor can I be angry with my own kinsman or hate him. *We were born for cooperation*. "

"You are old; don't let this directing mind of yours be enslaved any longer-- no more jerking to the strings of selfish impulse."

The main theme I take from book 1 is gratitude; from book 2, temperance and discipline.
