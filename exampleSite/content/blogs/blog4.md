# The 10000 km impactor

The 10000 km impactor: my greatest foe yet. I ran into the first issues of the code, and have ventured into the depths of the Fortran structure in order to try to fix it. The initial conditions are in a file called hydro.input, and so I have been tweaking 3 main parameters: initial timestep size, time between outputs, and max time. I figured out that since the impactor is so massive, so must be the max time, and increased it proportionally; it worked! I now have the results for the 10000 km impactor, the largest size presented in Dr. Johnson's paper. That culminates, therefore, the recreation of the data that already exists; next step, going smaller. _Wayyyyy_ smaller. Down to millimetric magnitudes, as has been the hope since the beginning of the project. 

This is what the results look like currently:

Pretty neat, huh?

We gotta go smaller now. I will keep you updated with the results. It can't be that hard. Right? _Right_?

# Los Angeles

I also had the opportunity to go to sunny Los Angeles, California, to visit a friend in UCLA, who's boyfriend, one of my best friends from back home, was visiting, and so we both stayed in UCLA's Dykstra Hall dorms; I slept on the floor happily knowing room and board was free. The campus is incredible, plucked right out from a movie. Or rather, movies plucked into the campus; after all, Hollywood loves to use UCLA as the stand-in for any university. Movies such as Oppenheimer, Legally Blonde, The Godfather, etc. Walking through the setting of such incredible blockbusters felt unreal. 

The buildings are beautiful, seamlessly blended into the Westwood neighborhood; the halls and houses borrow from Spanish colonial architecture to create an environment that is both cozy and breathtaking. The surrounding Westwood streets are just as spectacular; the Regency Bruin theater in particular caught my attention, where Margot Robbie, as Sharon Tate, watches her big screen debut in Once Upon a Time in Hollywood.   

We visited Santa Monica, Bevery Hills, Hollywood, and my personal favorite, Venice Beach, a place that made me feel like I was in a Red Hot Chilli Peppers music video. We bathed in the cold March sea and walked to the boardwalk; the blindingly orange sunset blanketed us. 

Overall, an amazing experience; I am grateful for the chance to visit such a mythical city. Definitely a trip to remember. 

# Reading!

I might just dedicate a section in each blog to my current reads. I need a clever name though. I'll think of something.

Anyways; I'm almost done reading Jurassic Park. I have been a lifelong fan of the movie, and the book just takes the experience to a whole new level. I especially like Dr. Ian Malcolm's character, the eccentric mathematician who's constantly spouting ill omens and chaos theory. 

I feel like reading classics next; there is a used bookstore nearby, Von's fashion; I'm gonna go hunting for older books. I have Pride and Prejudice in my mind right now.
